# Introduction

AllegroForthKit \(aka AFKit\) is a framework for making games \(and other apps\) in standard Forth using [Allegro 5](www.liballeg.org).

It's written to the DPANS94 standard.

AFKit consists of a collection of ANS-compatible libraries, bindings for external libraries, core modules, and optional libraries.

_Note: The words "module" and "library" are used interchangeably, in the sense that a library is a kind of module._
