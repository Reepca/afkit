# Introduction

AllegroForthKit \(aka AFKit\) is a framework for making games \(and other apps\) with Allegro 5 in standard Forth.

It's written to the DPANS94 standard.

It contains ANS-compatible libraries, bindings for external libraries, core modules, and optional libraries. \(The words "module" and "library" are used interchangeably, but only in the sense that a library is a kind of module.\)
